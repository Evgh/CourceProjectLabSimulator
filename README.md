# Physics lab simulator created on Unity
_**Laboratory Topic is "Measuring capacitance of capacitors using Wheatston Bridge"**_

At the beginning of the third year of university, I got acquainted with Unity technology and mastered its basics.

As part of the cource project, I worked with the camera, used FirstPersonController. I created simple animations on my own, and also used the plugin DoTween for this purpose.
